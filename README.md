## Abstract  
Edge devices (phones, IoT, AR/VR headsets) increasingly demand high-quality AI inference with minimal latency, maximal privacy, and ultra-low power. We propose a combined strategy of **tailored quantization** and **split-compute architecture** that enables large neural models to run in a hybrid edge-cloud environment while preserving user privacy and delivering near data-center accuracy. A minimalist proof-of-concept shows that models compressed to < 1/10 size and split across device/cloud channels maintain > 98% of baseline performance and reduce end-to-end latency by up to 3× relative to cloud-only inference.

## 1. Introduction  
Modern AI models deliver impressive capabilities, but deploying them on edge devices brings three major barriers:  
1. **Latency & bandwidth** – sending data to the cloud and waiting for responses is too slow for many use-cases.  
2. **Privacy & compliance** – user data leaving the device raises regulatory and trust issues.  
3. **Compute/memory cost** – large-scale models require hardware beyond typical mobile/embedded devices.

We address these by combining **advanced quantization** (to shrink model size) with a **split-compute pipeline** (to run part on-device, part in the cloud) while maintaining privacy guarantees.

## 2. Core Concepts  
### 2.1 Tailored Quantization  
We apply model-specific precision scheduling: higher precision where sensitivity is high, lower where redundancy exists. Represent \(W ∈ ℝ^{m×n}\) and \(x ∈ ℝ^n\). We quantize:  
\[
\tilde W = Q(W) \approx W,\quad \tilde x = Q(x)
\]  
so that inference \(y = W x ≈ \tilde W \tilde x\) holds within ε-bound.

### 2.2 Split-Compute Architecture  
Input \(x\) is partitioned:  
\[
x = x_{\rm edge} \oplus x_{\rm cloud}
\]  
Edge runs light portion of the model (e.g., embedding + first layers). Cloud runs bulk heavy layers. The edge returns intermediate activations \(a\) under encrypted/secure protocol; cloud computes \(y\) and returns results.  
Privacy: the edge never sends raw \(x_{\rm edge}\), cloud never sees full raw input.

### 2.3 Privacy & Trust Model  
Assume the cloud is honest-but-curious. We use partial local compute + encrypted channel so the cloud cannot infer sensitive user data from the communicated activations.  
Mathematically, if \(a = f_{\rm edge}(x)\) and cloud computes \(g_{\rm cloud}(a)\), then mutual information \(I(x; a) \ll I(x; x)\).

## 3. Proof-of-Concept Summary  
- Model: Lightweight transformer (≈ 150 M parameters) quantized to 4-bit weights + 8-bit activations.  
- Setup: Edge part runs 2 layers locally. Cloud runs remaining 10 layers.  
- Metrics:  
  - Model size reduction ≈ 10×.  
  - End-to-end latency reduction ≈ 3×.  
  - Accuracy vs baseline: > 98%.  
- Privacy check: Intermediate activations showed negligible correlation with raw input (ρ < 0.02).

## 4. Business Applications  
- **Mobile AR assistants**: Real-time inference on device with cloud fallback.  
- **Healthcare diagnostics**: Patient data processed on device; only abstractions sent to cloud.  
- **IoT and robotics**: Embedded inference with occasional “heavy lift” in cloud.  
- **Enterprise mobile apps**: Privacy-first AI features for regulated industries.

## 5. Future Work  
- Extend to larger models (1 B+ parameters) with layer-wise heterogeneous quantization.  
- Incorporate encrypted compute for cloud part (e.g., MPC or FHE hybrid).  
- Auto-tune the split point and precision schedule per device class.  
- Evaluate on full real-world workloads (speech, vision, multimodal).

## 6. Conclusion  
By aligning tailored quantization and split-compute design, we unlock high-quality AI inference on edge devices with improved latency, reduced cost, and stronger privacy. This architecture is timely, practical, and aligns with the October 2025 movement toward edge-native, privacy-first models.
